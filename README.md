### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am a BS-MS Physics and Data Science graduate from [IISER Mohali](https://iisermohali.ac.in/). I did my thesis on the study of event-by-event fluctuations in heavy ion collisions. I am currently looking for PhD opportunities in particle physics. Check out my [website](https://athirasreejith25-personal-website-home-twvwda.streamlit.app/) to know more about me.
